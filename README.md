## Notes About LethalLevelLoader
Since there's a lot of conflicting interiors, the LLL config tends to get overwritten with garbage. There's probably a good way to fix this, but the easiest way to avoid this is to set your LLL config file to be read-only. This will retain the published config and allow all interiors to spawn on all moons.
